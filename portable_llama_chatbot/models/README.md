# Download models

Any model that is supported by `llama-cpp-python` should work.
Download the models and save them in `models` folder.

## Default model

Download `Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct` from https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/qwen2.5-3b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf
and save it in `models` folder.
